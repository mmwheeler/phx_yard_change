I am conducting a research project to understand the dynamics of residential yards based on resident preferences and management behaviors. In the summer of 2018, I will be repeating an ecological survey of residential yard vegetation originally conducted in 2008 to characterize front yard vegetation at two time points 10 years apart. I will pair this ecological survey with a social survey to understand resident preferences, changes made to their yards, and motivations for making changes.
