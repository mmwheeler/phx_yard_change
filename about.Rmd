Hello! My name is Megan Wheeler and I am a fourth year PhD student at Arizona State University in the [Hall Lab](https://halllab.asu.edu/), which has a broad focus on the ecology of native and managed ecosystems.

I am interested in how the decisions people make affect ecological outcomes, and for my dissertation work I am focusing on how urban and urban-influenced plant communities change over time. I find urban ecosystems especially interesting because they are where most people now live and work, they have disproportionately large impacts on Earth's ecology and biogeochemistry, and they are ideal places to understand how people interact with and manage ecosystems.

Most of the time, I work with existing datasets, which are often larger or cover longer time periods than what I could collect myself. Some of my current projects use data from the [Central Arizona Long Term Ecological Research project](https://sustainability.asu.edu/caplter/), an NSF-funded project focused on understanding long term ecological trends in the Phoenix metropolitan area. As part of this work, I am investigating how water and nutrient availability affect annual plant communities (wildflowers!) in the Sonoran Desert.

Before coming to ASU, I began work with an NSF-funded MacroSystems Biology project, [Ecological Homogenization of Urban America](http://ecologicalhomogenization.com/). As part of this work I studied the [composition of residential lawns across the US to test the urban homogenization hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204617301081), and found that lawn species composition is quite similar across the country, and that spontaneous species (those that grow on their own rather than being planted) were actually more similar than were planted turfgrass species. I've continued to work with this group as a graduate student, comparing residential yards of different types in Phoenix and across the country. 

At ASU, I also work with the [Decision Center for a Desert City](https://sustainability.asu.edu/dcdc/) on a project seeking to understand changes in Phoenix residential landscaping over time, and the implications these changes have for urban water use. Outdoor landscape irrigation is a very large component of overall residential water use, and so understanding why people choose to have or remove water-intensive landscaping has applications in water conservation and policy planning.
