### June 2018

<br>

As of the end of May, we have finished making plant species lists for 103 of our ~400 yards, so about a quarter of the way through! Early progress was a bit slow as I learned more plants and taught my student assistants, but now we are really rolling! Our goal is to sample about 10 yards per field day, and we are pretty consistantly getting there. We've had lots of great conversations with the residents whose plants we are observing. Everyone has been very friendly and willing to help, which has absolutely made this project easier and more fun.

So far, we have primarily sampled in three neighborhoods, with a fourth still to come. Most of the yards we've observed have had xeric-type landscaping, with crushed stone and a mixture of shrubs, trees, and succulents. 

As observed in 2008, lantana, bougainvillea, oleander, and Texas sage are among the most commonly planted species, with lantana in 48% of yards, bougainvillea in 36%, oleander in 31%, and Texas sage in 21%. Red yucca was in 34% of yards and pygmy date palm was in 30% of yards, both more common than observed in 2008. This may change as I begin to sample the 4th neighborhood, or may be the beginnings of an actual trend over time.

I've also observed some differences in species composition by neighborhood, with the lawn-dominated neighborhood notably containing more asparagus fern, ash trees, pittosporum, and rose than the two xeriscape-dominated neighborhoods. 

Alternatively, more xeriscaped yards contain mesquite trees and palo verde trees, but also appear to more frequently contain common species like oleander and Texas sage. This could reflect other differences in the neighborhoods I've sampled or differences in overall number of plants in these different types of yards, so this will warrent some further exploration.

More updates coming soon! We are continuing on with our plant sampling and will be mailing the resident survey out in the next week!

### May 2018

We are getting started with data collection for the summer! The resident questionnaire is headed to the printer shortly, and we have begun visiting the sample neighborhoods to record yard plant species composition.

So far, there has been more change in yard plant communities than I expected, which is exciting to see!

I've had to brush up on my palm tree identification, so spent some time at the local Home Depot to see what was for sale. It's not too difficult to tell Pygmy Date Palm (*Phoenix roebelenii*) and Sago Palm (*Cycus revoluta*) apart...

But it turns out there are some fan palms that look pretty similar, including a commonly cultivated hybrid of *Washingtonia robusta* and *Washingtonia filiforma*, called *Washingtonia filibusta*. Meanwhile, European fan palm (*Chamaerops humilis*) looks similar, but is in an entirely different genus and tends to grow in clumps rather than individually.

The rest of my summer team will be joining me soon, and we'll continue sampling yard vegetation. I'm sure there will be more plant identification questions soon to come!
